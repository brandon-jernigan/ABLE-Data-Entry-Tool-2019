# ABLE-Data-Entry-Tool-2019
ABLE Data Entry Tool is software made for the University of Arizona Biorepository which greatly simplifies data entry for the Tissue Metrix 2 biobanking data management platform. Tissue Metrix 2 requires every detail be entered for each sample, and that each set of samples to be placed into it's storage location by navigating a tree of storage devices. This is simplified by this program by grouping together typical configurations of sample descriptions for each type of sample, and by automatically assigning storage locations based on the current designated storage devices for each lab's collection at the Biorepository.
