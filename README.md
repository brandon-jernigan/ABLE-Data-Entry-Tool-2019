# ABLE-Data-Entry-Tool-2019
ABLE Data Entry Tool is software made for the University of Arizona Biorepository which greatly simplifies data entry for the AIM Tissue Metrix 2 biobanking data management platform, saving our organization several hours or work each week. Tissue Metrix 2 requires every detail be entered for each sample, and that each set of samples to be placed into it's storage location by navigating a tree of storage devices. This is simplified by the ABLE Data Entry Tool by grouping together typical configurations of sample descriptions for each type of sample, and by automatically assigning storage locations based on the current designated storage devices for each lab's collection at the Biorepository. An XML file is generated from the results and imported into Tissue Metrix 2, which directly assigns the details for the samples in the imported package.
